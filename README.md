# Employee Summary

## Homework #8

### As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles.

***

# How it works

The goal is to creat a software engineering team generator command line application (CLI). The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns.

- Using the Command Line, type "node app.js".

- The command will then request the information you would like to store.

- Follow the prompts until you see a log that says "Success!".

- Then, open team.html in the output folder.

"Success!" You have created an employee management site.
